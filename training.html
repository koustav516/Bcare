                        Our institution houses a
                        <strong>dedicated Training & Placement Cell</strong>
                        aimed at supporting both current students and alumni in
                        securing industry-relevant training and job placements.

                    <p>
                        The cell is structured under two collaborative teams:<br />

                        Students are routinely placed for short-term industrial
                        training with tenures ranging from
                        <strong>15 days to 6 months</strong>, depending on the
                        host organization’s structure. These training programs
                        help students gain real-world technical exposure and
                        soft skills.
