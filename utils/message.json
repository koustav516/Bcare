Though founded in 2005, the institution received AICTE approval and WBSCTVESD affiliation in 2011. We offer diploma courses in Civil, Electrical, Electronics & Telecommunication, and Mechanical Engineering. I sincerely invite students, with their guardians' consent, to join our institution and build a future as successful technocrats with promising career opportunities across India."
